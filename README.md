## PyBank
PyBank is a Python exercise by which the "main" file analyzes bank records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
